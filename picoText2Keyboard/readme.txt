You may need to get the keyboard layout libs from here:
https://github.com/Neradoc/Circuitpython_Keyboard_Layouts/tree/main

Download the release and copy the  contents of the unzipped 'lib' folder to your pico's 'lib' folder on the root of the pico.

You will also need Circuit Python, or Micropython with the adafruits libs. I have used Circuit Python version 9.
Get circuit python from here:
https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/

My whole pico directory and code is available for download, 
You should only have to flash your pico with circuit python
and then copy the folders over to your pico and youre done!

I have included the lastest Circuit python and all the libs required.
Feel free to download them yourself from the official links above :)
